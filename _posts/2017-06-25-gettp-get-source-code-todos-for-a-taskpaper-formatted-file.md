This is a quick and simple Python script that uses [Ag &#8211; The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) to find &#8216;TODO&#8217; items in a source tree.

The output is formatted for the [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) plain text format and sent to stdout. The output can be piped to a .taskpaper file.

Nothing fancy. Ag is super fast and does the heavy lifting. The Python code formats the Ag format to TaskPaper.

* The current directory name is used for the root project name.
* Each file with TODO's are sub-projects. The sub-project names include relative directories.
* Tasks begin with the line number of the TODO.

```yaml
  gettp:

    getTP.py:
      - line: 2    Combine TODO's to a TaskPaper list
      - line: 8    todo_command = 'ag TODO'
      - line: 13   Use Ag Silver Searcher to find TODO comments in source

    README.md:
      - line: 1    # getTP - Get Source Code TODO's for a TaskPaper formatted file
      - line: 3    This is a quick and simple Python script that uses [Ag - The Silver Searcher]...

    sample//test.md:
      - line: 5    * TODO: Ad nulla ad Lorem quis et quis in in laborum incididunt adipisicing occaecat id voluptate.
```
