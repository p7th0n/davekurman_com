## Tea Glass

<pre>
In the quiet corners of a restless mind,
I seek the verses, once so well-defined.
A long-lost love, a whisper in the past,
Yet all I grasp, those words: a tea glass.

Fragments of a romance etched in time,
Elusive lines like shadows, hard to find.
The scent of distant evenings fills the air,
But all I hear: the clinking tea glass, rare.

Memories dance like dust in fading light,
Echoes of a poem, soft and bright.
Your laughter mingled with the sound,
Of a tea glass gently set down.

Through the haze of years and fleeting dreams,
The heart recalls what reason deems.
Love lost to time, yet held so dear,
In the fragile clink of a tea glass, near.

I search my soul for stanzas lost,
In words unspoken, dreams it cost.
Yet in my heart, the essence stays,
A tea glass, a love that never decays.
