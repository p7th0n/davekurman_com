• Developed a web app for the Wallace Deer Management Association (WDMA). The WDMA is a group of experienced bowhunters who manage local deer populations. App supported personal profiles and access for all WDMA hunters, and landowner knowledge of persons hunting on their property.

• Using a simple point and click interface hunters reserve stands for hunting. The web app uses a set of rules to handle tree stand availability.

• The website provides real-time summary and detail reports. Data includes hunters, reservations, harvests, venison donations and other information. Reports are available for previous years as well.

• Ruby on Rails uses the Agile development process for the website. This Agile process was a key when working with the hunters on the website, allowing for iteration through feature requests and bug fixes to develop the site.
